    "text": "Dataset\nDataset represents the highest levels in the hierarchy. It is the main keystone in the VegVault structure.\n\n\nDataset Type\ndataset_type_id defines the basic type of a dataset. This is the highest level of classification of the data\nCurrently, there VegVault consist of those types:\n\nvegetation_plot - current vegetation plot dataset\nfossil_pollen_archive - past vegetation plot dataset\ntraits - dataset containing functional traits\ngridpoints - artificially created dataset to hold abiotic data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Source-Type\ndataset_source_type_id defines the general provider of the dataset. This should help to classify, which data pipeline was used to import the dataset into the VegVault, This is also the first general point of reference of data, as all large databases have a citation statement.\nCurrently, the VegVault consist of those source-types:\n\nBIEN - Botanical Information and Ecology Network\nsPlotOpen - The open-access version of sPlot\nTRY - TRY Plant Trait Database\nFOSSILPOL - The workflow that aims to process and standardise global palaeoecological pollen data\ngridpoints - artificially created dataset to hold abiotic data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Source\nEach individual dataset from a specific Data Source-Type can have information on the source of the data (i.e. sub-database). This should help to promote better findability of the primary source of data and referencing.\n\nCurrently, there are 706 sources of datasets.\n\n\n\nSampling method\nSome datasets may differ in the way they have been sampled. This could be represented by different ways vegetation data have been sampled for Dataset Type of vegetation_plot, or depositional environment for Dataset Type of fossil_pollen_archive.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nDataset Source-Type, Dataset Source, and Sampling Method can have their own references. Moreover, each dataset can have one or more references directly to that specific data.\n\nThis means that one dataset can have one/several references from each of those parts. Let’s take a look at an example, of what that could mean in practice.\nWe have selected dataset ID: 91256, which is a fossil pollen archive. Therefore, it has the reference of the Dataser Source-Type: https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13693 and reference for the individual dataset: Grimm, E.C., 2008. Neotoma: an ecosystem database for the Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene. Illinois State Museum Scientific Papers E Series, 1."

Therefore, the information about the plot is saved separately.\n\n\n\n\nSample age\nThe VegVault database deals with both current and paleo data. Therefore, each Sample has the indication of age, with modern samples being set to 0. To embrace the uncertainty from age-depth modeling paleo-record, the VegVault database has a structure to hold an uncertainty matrix containing information about all potential ages of each Sample from a paleo Dataset.\n\nWe can show this on the previously selected fossil pollen archive with dataset ID: 91256.\n\n\n\nSample reference\nIndividual Sample can have specific references on top of the reference to Dataset"
